Biofiber reinforced composite

## Bio-Fiber Reinforced Composite Property Prediction

This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict the mechanical properties of bio-fiber reinforced composites (BRCs).

**Problem:** Predicting BRC properties is challenging due to various influencing factors like fiber type, processing conditions, etc. This makes material design and optimization inefficient.

**Solution:** We proposes collecting a comprehensive dataset of BRC properties and influencing factors. Then, we'll train an ML model to predict these properties based on the collected data.

**Benefits:**
* Improved material design and optimization for BRCs.
* Enhanced quality control in BRC manufacturing.
* Better understanding of the relationships between BRC properties and influencing factors.

**Stay tuned for updates!**
